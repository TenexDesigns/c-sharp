In C#, comments are used to add explanatory notes or documentation within the code.
Comments are ignored by the compiler and have no impact on the execution of the program.
They serve as a way to improve code readability and provide additional information for developers or future maintainers of the code.
Heres an explanation of the different types of comments in C# with code samples:

Single-line Comments:
Single-line comments start with // and continue until the end of the line. They are used for brief comments or explanations on a single line.
csharp
Copy code
int x = 5;  // This is a single-line comment
Multi-line Comments:
Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */. They can span multiple lines and are used for longer comments or block explanations.
csharp
Copy code
/*
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span multiple lines.
*/
