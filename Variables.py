Variables and Constants


Variable : - A name give to a storage location in memeory
Contsnt : - An immutable value  


DECLARING VARAIBLES

int number;
int Number =1

The first and last are not the same , as c# is a case sensitive langiage, so the first and last are not the same,
We can not use a varialbe that is not inistailzed

DECLARING CONSTABNTS
We have to intialize a constant and set its value

const float Pi = 3.14f



NAMING CONVENTIONS
camel case = firstName
pascal Case = FirstName
Hungarialn Notation = strFirstName  --> Not used in C#



for local variable : Camel case ----- > int number;
for constants  :Pascal case     ----- > constant int MaxZom = 5;        


primitive types in c#


In C#, primitive types are the basic data types provided by the language to represent simple values. These types are built into the C# language and are used to store common types of data. Here are the primitive types in C#:

Boolean: Represents a Boolean value that can be either true or false.

Byte: Represents an 8-bit unsigned integer value.

SByte: Represents an 8-bit signed integer value.

Char: Represents a single Unicode character.

Decimal: Represents a decimal floating-point number with higher precision than float or double.

Double: Represents a double-precision floating-point number.

Float: Represents a single-precision floating-point number.

Int: Represents a 32-bit signed integer value.

UInt: Represents a 32-bit unsigned integer value.

Long: Represents a 64-bit signed integer value.

ULong: Represents a 64-bit unsigned integer value.

Short: Represents a 16-bit signed integer value.

UShort: Represents a 16-bit unsigned integer value.

IntPtr: Represents a signed pointer or a signed integer that is the same size as a pointer. Used for interoperability with unmanaged code.

UIntPtr: Represents an unsigned pointer or an unsigned integer that is the same size as a pointer. Used for interoperability with unmanaged code.

These primitive types provide a way to store and manipulate basic data in C#. Each type has its own range of values and memory requirements.
Additionally, C# also provides non-primitive types such as strings, arrays, classes, and structures, which are built using these primitive types.
