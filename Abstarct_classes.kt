In C#, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly, but can be used as a base for other classes.
It serves as a blueprint for derived classes and provides a common set of properties, methods, and events that those classes must implement.
The abstract keyword is used to define an abstract class in C#.

Heres an example of an abstract class in C#:


abstract class Shape
{
    public abstract double Area(); // Abstract method

    public void Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("This is a shape.");
    }
}
In the above code, Shape is an abstract class that contains an abstract method Area() and a non-abstract method Display(). 
The Area() method doesnt have any implementation, and it must be implemented in the derived classes.

To create a derived class from an abstract class, you use the : symbol followed by the name of the abstract class. 
The derived class must provide an implementation for all the abstract methods defined in the abstract class. Heres an example:


class Rectangle : Shape
{
    private double length;
    private double width;

    public Rectangle(double length, double width)
    {
        this.length = length;
        this.width = width;
    }

    public override double Area()
    {
        return length * width;
    }
}
In the above code, Rectangle is a derived class from the abstract class Shape. It implements the Area() method defined in the Shape class.

Abstract classes are useful when you want to provide a common interface and behavior for a group of related classes, 
while still allowing each derived class to have its own specific implementation. They help in achieving abstraction, encapsulation, and code reusability.

Here are a few use cases and applications of abstract classes in C#:

Inheritance: Abstract classes are often used as base classes to define a common interface and behavior for a group of derived classes.
For example, you can have an abstract class Animal with abstract methods like Eat() and Sleep(), and then have derived classes like
Dog and Cat that implement these methods based on their specific behavior.

Polymorphism: Abstract classes can be used to achieve polymorphism by defining abstract methods that must be implemented by derived classes.
This allows you to treat objects of different derived classes as instances of the abstract base class.

Frameworks and libraries: Abstract classes are commonly used in frameworks and libraries to provide a base implementation for certain functionalities. 
Derived classes can then extend or override these implementations as per their specific requirements.

Overall, abstract classes in C# provide a powerful mechanism for defining common interfaces, ensuring consistency across derived classes, 
and promoting code reuse and extensibility.

Abstract classes in C# are classes that cannot be instantiated. Instead, they serve as a base class for other classes to inherit from.
Abstract classes are used to define a common set of behaviors or properties that derived classes should have. They can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods. Abstract methods are methods that have no implementation in the abstract class and must be implemented by any derived class (guru99.com, geeksforgeeks.org).

To create an abstract class in C#, you need to use the abstract keyword before the class definition. For example:

abstract class Tutorial
{
    public virtual void Set() 
    {
        
    }
}
In this example, Tutorial is an abstract class with a virtual method called Set. Virtual methods can be overridden by derived classes,
but they dont have to be (guru99.com).

To create a derived class that inherits from an abstract class, you can use the following syntax:

class Guru99Tutorial : Tutorial
{
    protected int TutorialID;
    protected string TutorialName;

    public void SetTutorial(int pID, string pName) 
    {
        TutorialID = pID;
        TutorialName = pName;
    }

    public String GetTutorial()
    {
        return TutorialName;
    }
}
In this example, the Guru99Tutorial class inherits from the Tutorial abstract class and provides
its own implementation of the SetTutorial and GetTutorial methods (guru99.com).

Abstract classes have several advantages and disadvantages:

Advantages:

Encapsulation: They allow you to define a common set of behaviors or properties that derived classes should have,
without exposing the implementation details to the outside world (geeksforgeeks.org).
Code reuse: They can be used as a base class for multiple derived classes, which can help reduce code duplication and improve code reuse (geeksforgeeks.org).
Polymorphism: They can be used to achieve polymorphism, which allows you to write code that works with objects 
of different derived classes, as long as they all inherit from the same abstract base class (geeksforgeeks.org).
Disadvantages:

Tight coupling: They can create tight coupling between the base class and derived classes, which can make it harder to modify the
base class without affecting the derived classes (geeksforgeeks.org).
Limited inheritance: C# only allows a class to inherit from a single base class, so if you use an abstract class as a base class, 
you limit the ability of derived classes to inherit from other classes (geeksforgeeks.org).
Difficulty in testing: Because abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly, they can be more difficult to test than regular
classes. In order to test a derived class, you may need to create a mock or stub of the abstract base class (geeksforgeeks.org).
In conclusion, abstract classes in C# are a powerful tool for creating flexible and maintainable code. They allow you to define
a common set of behaviors or properties that derived classes should have, and they can be used to achieve polymorphism. 
However, they should be used judiciously, taking into account the specific requirements of your application.

An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated. Instead, it serves as a base class for other classes to inherit from. 
Abstract classes are used to define a common set of behaviors or properties that derived classes should have.

To create an abstract class in C#, you use the abstract keyword. For example:

C#
public abstract class Animal
{
    public abstract void Speak();
}
Use code with caution. Learn more
The Speak() method is an abstract method. It does not have a body, and it must be implemented by any class that inherits from Animal.

Here is an example of a class that inherits from Animal:

C#
public class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Woof!");
    }
}
Use code with caution. Learn more
The Dog class inherits from the Animal class and implements the Speak() method. This means that a Dog object can be created and its Speak() method can be called.

Abstract classes are useful for a number of reasons. They can be used to:

Define a common set of behaviors or properties for a group of classes.
Simplify the code for derived classes by providing them with a base implementation of common methods.
Prevent the instantiation of a class that should not be created directly.
Here are some examples of how abstract classes can be used in C#:

You can use an abstract class to define a common set of behaviors for a group of objects.
For example, you could create an abstract class called Shape that defines methods for drawing and rotating shapes.
You can use an abstract class to simplify the code for derived classes by providing them with a base implementation of common methods.
For example, you could create an abstract class called Animal that defines a method for speaking. Derived classes of Animal, such as Dog and Cat,
could then override this method to provide their own implementation of speaking.
You can use an abstract class to prevent the instantiation of a class that should not be created directly.
For example, you could create an abstract class called BankAccount that defines methods for depositing and withdrawing money. You would not want users to be able to create BankAccount objects directly, so you could make this class abstract.
Abstract classes are a powerful tool that can be used to improve the design and organization of your code.
