            // conditional operator = used in conditional assignment if a condition is true/false

            //(condition) ? x : y

      Here we say that if the condition is true, assing x, but if th condition is false, assing y




using System;

namespace MyFirstProgram
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {


            double temperature = 20;
            String message;

            message = (temperature >= 15) ? "It's warm outside!" : "It's cold outside!";

            Console.WriteLine(message);

        }
    }

****************************************************************************************************************************************************
The conditional operator (also known as the ternary operator) in C# is a compact way to write simple conditional expressions.
It provides a concise alternative to the if statement when you need to make a decision based on a condition. The conditional operator has the following syntax:

condition ? expression1 : expression2
Heres an explanation of the conditional operator in C# with code samples:

Example 1: Using Conditional Operator


int num = 10;
string result = num > 0 ? "Positive" : "Negative";
Console.WriteLine(result);  // Output: Positive
In this example, the condition num > 0 is evaluated. If its true, the expression Positive is assigned to result; otherwise, Negative is assigned.

Example 2: Assigning Minimum Value


int a = 5;
int b = 3;
int min = a < b ? a : b;
Console.WriteLine(min);  // Output: 3
In this example, the condition a < b is evaluated. If its true, the value of a is assigned to min; otherwise, the value of b is assigned.

Comparison with if Statement:

The conditional operator and the if statement are both used to make decisions based on conditions.
Here are the key differences:

Syntax: The conditional operator is a single-line expression with a compact syntax, 
  while the if statement is a control flow statement that uses blocks of code.

Complexity: The conditional operator is suitable for simple conditions and expressions that can be resolved in a single line.
  On the other hand, the if statement can handle complex conditions and execute multiple statements within its block.

Readability: The if statement provides more flexibility and readability when dealing with complex conditions and multiple branches,
  as it allows for more descriptive code blocks.

Side Effects: The conditional operator evaluates both expressions regardless of the conditions outcome.
  In contrast, the if statement allows for additional logic and code execution based on the conditions result.

Choosing between the conditional operator and the if statement depends on the complexity and readability of the code.
The conditional operator is preferred for simple conditions and concise expressions, 
while the if statement is more suitable for complex conditions and multi-line code blocks.

Example: Comparing Conditional Operator and If Statement


int x = 10;
int y = 5;

// Using conditional operator
string result1 = x > y ? "x is greater" : "y is greater";
Console.WriteLine(result1);  // Output: x is greater

// Using if statement
string result2;
if (x > y)
{
    result2 = "x is greater";
}
else
{
    result2 = "y is greater";
}
Console.WriteLine(result2);  // Output: x is greater
In summary, the conditional operator provides a concise way to write simple conditional expressions.
It can be used as an alternative to the if statement when the condition and resulting expressions are straightforward.
However, for more complex conditions and code blocks, the if statement offers greater flexibility and readability.
