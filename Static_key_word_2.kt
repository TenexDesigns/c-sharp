In C#, the static keyword is used to declare members (methods, fields, properties) that belong to the type itself rather than instances of the type.
When applied to a method, the static keyword indicates that the method can be invoked without creating an instance of the class.

Heres an explanation of the static keyword and its usage with methods, specifically the Main method in C#:

Static Members:
When a member (method, field, property) is declared as static, it means that the member is associated with the type itself rather than individual instances of the type. 
Static members can be accessed directly from the type, without needing to create an instance of the class.

Static Methods:
Static methods are methods that are associated with the type rather than specific instances. They can be invoked directly on the class itself, 
without creating an object of the class. Static methods are commonly used for utility functions, helper methods, or entry points of the program.

The Main Method:
In C#, the Main method serves as the entry point of a program. It is declared as static because it needs to be accessed without creating
an instance of the programs class. When the program is executed, the runtime environment automatically calls the Main method to start the programs execution.

Example:


class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Code to start the program
    }
}
In this example, the Main method is declared as static. It can be accessed directly without creating an instance of the Program class.
When the program is run, the runtime environment automatically calls the Main method to start executing the program.

Benefits of Static Methods:

They can be invoked without creating instances, making them convenient for utility methods or when you dont need to maintain state-specific data.
They improve performance since they dont require memory allocation for object instances.
They provide a centralized location for common functionality that can be accessed globally.
However, its important to note that static methods cannot access non-static (instance) members directly since they dont have access to the state of a particular instance.


In summary, the static keyword in C# is used to declare members (methods, fields, properties) that are associated with
the type itself rather than instances of the type. When applied to a method, it indicates that the method can be accessed without
creating an instance of the class. The static keyword is used with the Main method to define the entry point of a program.
