c# vs .NET

C# is a programinnign language
.net is a framwoerk for building applications on windows, .Net is not limited to only C# as there are other languages that can can be used
to build   appications on top of .net, e.g f# and v.net


.NET FRAMWORK
It is comprsed of the folloowing
CLR (Common  Language Runtime)  - c# shap is platform independednt becuse it is first transformed to Itermindie Langiage code(IL code), before it is transformed into native machine code, CLR covertes this Intermdeiaete Language Code into the native machib=ne code threouc  aprocess called Just In Time compilation or JiT
Class Libray  - For building applications




ARCHITECTURE OF .NET APPLICATIONS


APPLICATION - On a high level, your application consit of building claseese. This classes work together during runtime to provide some functionality


Class is a container which has data(also called attribyted) and functions (also caleed methods)
  In real world applications there are lots of classes with different functionaliyt, e.g get data from the user, process the data , and so on
  As the number of classes grow in our application, we need a way to organise these clases, That is where Namespace comes in
  
  NAMESPACE - IS A CONTAINER FOR RELATED CLASESS
  We have namespaces for working with graphics and images,we have namespeces for working with databases, we have namespaces for working with security

As our namespeces grow and increase , we need a way to group thses name spaces, and that is where ASSEMBLY COMES IN

ASSEMBLY - Is a container for related name spaces, pysicaliy it can be a file on the disc , which can either be an excutable, or a dll(dynamicaly linked libray)
  
  When a compiler excutes your aplication, it is partion to one or more assemblyies depending on how you partion your code
