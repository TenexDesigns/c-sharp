Class Libray  - For building applications




ARCHITECTURE OF .NET APPLICATIONS


APPLICATION - On a high level, your application consit of building claseese. This classes work together during runtime to provide some functionality


Class is a container which has data(also called attribyted) and functions (also caleed methods)
  In real world applications there are lots of classes with different functionaliyt, e.g get data from the user, process the data , and so on
